**IS1200 Computer Hardware Engineering (7.5 credits) offers a comprehensive understanding of computer functionality and construction from both hardware and software angles. The course comprises six modules covering topics such as C-programming, assembler language, I/O systems, digital design, processor construction, memory architectures, and parallel processing. Prerequisite knowledge is recommended for Module 3, available on the course homepage. Upon completion, students will be proficient in implementing low-level programs, analyzing processor and memory architectures, comparing multiprocessor systems, and effectively communicating technical solutions. Higher grades entail constructing more complex programs and engaging in in-depth discussions as specified in the course memo.**
